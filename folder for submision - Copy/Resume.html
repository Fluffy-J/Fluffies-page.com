<h2>profile</h2>
I am young enthusiastic & energetic varsity student I am currently doing a diploma in information coummunications technology at  cape peninsula universiy of thechnology.
I matriculated in the year 2021 at<a href ="school sky city">Royal school skycity</a>. 
I was privileged enough to be elected as a prefect for 2 years in a row in the years 2020 & 2021.
Being a prefect taught me a few things about leadership. 
A lesson I learnt I believe a number of us overlook is leading by example.
During school holidays I would take the opportunity to work as a security officer & control room officer.<br>
